    <p class="text-justify">
      It has been many years since the original development of slotlist.info began – and every time I am fascinated to see new missions being created here on a regular basis.
      <br>Unfortunately, my personal time in the ArmA community is long gone, which is why the project has only been running "on the side" in recent years and has hardly been kept up to date. It has now reached a point where the architecture and server infrastructure used are so outdated that they would need to be completely modernised, for which I unfortunately lack the time and resources.
      <br>
      <br><span class="font-weight-bold">For this reason, I have come to the difficult decision to discontinue the project at the end of 2025.
      <br><span class="text-danger">slotlist.info will be shut down on 31 December 2025.</span></span>
      <br>
      <br>If there is interest in archiving or further utilising the data collected over the years, I will create a final backup of the database when it is shut down and can make it available upon request (preferably via email to <a href="mailto:nick@slotlist.info?subject=slotlist.info - Data archive">nick@slotlist.info</a>). The source code for the project will, of course, remain available as an archive on <a href="https://github.com/MorpheusXAUT/slotlist-frontend"><i class="fa fa-github" aria-hidden=‘true’></i> GitHub</a>.
      <br>
      <br>I am grateful for all the years during which so many of you have contributed to and used this site!
